  Failures:
    1) this test will fail (FAILED -1)
       expected true to be false

  Finished in 0.71876 seconds
  5 examples, 1 failure, 2 skipped

Here's the code for this:

  require 'rtomayko'

  describe "Doing a simple test", :type => :rtomayko do
    it "this test will run" do
      true.should be_true
    end
  
    it "this test will run too" do
      true.should be_true
    end
  
    it "this test will fail" do
      true.should be_false
    end
  
    it "this test will be skipped" do
      raise "will not be run!"
    end
  
    it "this test will be skipped too" do
      raise "will not be run!"
    end
  end
